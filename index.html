      <p>I love books! It may sound strange, but I really do. Ever since I was a little girl I've read a lot of books. I really love to drift away into the
fantasyworld of a book. This is what I think is the best about reading but there are other advantages
about reading., let me describe a few.
To begin with it's very relaxing. You can sit down at a quiet place and just forget about the world
around you for a while. Sometimes when I feel like I have a million things to do I take a
break, make a cup of tea and cuddle up in the corner of the sofa with a good book. After just a little
while of reading I've got my strength up to take care of everything. It's also a great way to calm down
before going to bed.
Secondly you can bring a book with you almost everywhere. It doesn't matter if youâ€™re on the subway,
        on the bus, on the beach or on a journey. There's always room for a book in the bag.</p>
